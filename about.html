    I am a versatile professional with a strong academic foundation and a diverse skill set suitable for roles in Data Science, Machine Learning Engineering, 
    and Software Engineering. Holding a Bachelor of Technology in Electrical & Electronics Engineering from Cochin University of Science & Technology, 
    Master of Science in Robotics (Concentration in Electrical & Computer Engineering) and a Graduate Certificate in Business Administration, from 
    Northeastern University, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and business acumen to the table.
    My technical skills encompass a broad spectrum of programming languages, including C, Python, MATLAB, Arduino, HTML5, CSS, ROS, Java, and JavaScript. 
    In the realm of data engineering, I am proficient in SQL, Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse Analytics, Microsoft Power BI and Tableau. I am well-versed
     in popular libraries such as PySpark, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV, making me adept at handling data-driven projects.<br>

    In my professional journey, I served as an Associate Software Engineer at Ernst & Young (EY) in Kochi, India, from October 2021 to June 2022.
    During this tenure, I played a pivotal role in creating and managing data warehouses for the EY Assurance team as part of the Assurance Data Integration Project.
    My responsibilities included developing Python scripts and Azure Data Factory pipelines to automate data discovery, manipulation, and storage in data lakes. 
    Additionally, I conducted Quality Assurance testing, generated visualizations, and prepared reports to ensure data accuracy and program effectiveness.
    My achievements underscore my commitment to excellence. I achieved the second position internationally in the Myron Zucker Project Design contest organized 
    by the IEEE Industrial Applications Society, showcasing my engineering prowess. I clinched the first position in a national-level VLSI competition hosted 
    by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee, highlighting my proficiency in software and hardware integration. My dedication to mentorship earned 
    me the Best Mentor Award from IEEE Outreach for Resources in Engineering (IEEE ORE) for my guidance in the field of Internet of Things.<br>
    
    In leadership capacities, I held the position of Chairperson for the IEEE Power & Energy Society at the CUSAT Student Branch, demonstrating my 
    ability to lead and organize technical initiatives. As a Research & Development Ambassador for the IEEE Power & Energy Society, Kerala Section, 
    I furthered my contributions to the technical community. Additionally, my role as Technical Lead at the Google Developer Student Club at CUSAT 
    reflects my competence in software engineering leadership.
    My academic projects showcase my innovative thinking and problem-solving skills, attributes valuable in the fields of Data Science, Machine Learning Engineering,
    and Software Engineering. Notably, I designed an All Directional Robot with specialized omni-directional wheels, Arduino, an HC05 Bluetooth module, and stepper
    motors. This innovation reduced vehicle turning space by 70% and earned international recognition from the IEEE Industrial Applications Society, demonstrating 
    my engineering capabilities.<br>
    
    Furthermore, I developed a Smart Cap for the Prevention of Contagious Diseases, which incorporates data-driven elements such as proximity detection and GPS 
    location tracking for outbreak management. My research paper on this project, published in the international journal "IEEE Bangalore Humanitarian Technology 
    Conference," showcases my ability to contribute valuable insights and solutions in data-centric domains.
    In conclusion, my comprehensive educational background, diverse technical skills, professional experience, achievements, and leadership roles make me a strong
     candidate for roles in Data Science, Machine Learning Engineering, and Software Engineering. I bring a holistic perspective to these domains, underpinned by a 
     solid foundation in robotics and electrical engineering.<br>
